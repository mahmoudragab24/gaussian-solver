# üìê Gauss-Jordan RREF Web Solver

**Solve systems of linear equations quickly and accurately by visualizing the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) steps.**

## üåü Overview

The **Gauss-Jordan RREF Web Solver** is a client-side web application designed to automatically solve systems of linear equations. It implements the **Gauss-Jordan Elimination** algorithm to convert the augmented matrix into the **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**.

The primary goal of this tool is twofold: to provide a **fast and accurate solver** for complex matrices, and to serve as an **educational resource** by displaying the **step-by-step row operations** performed during the calculation.

## üöÄ Live Demo and Access

You can access and use the solver immediately via the live deployment:

  * **Live Application:** [https://mahmoudragab24.github.io/gaussian-solver/](https://mahmoudragab24.github.io/gaussian-solver/)

## ‚ú® Features

  * **RREF Calculation:** Solves systems of equations using the robust Gauss-Jordan elimination method.
  * **Step-by-Step Solution:** Displays all elementary row operations performed to reach the final solution.
  * **Client-Side:** Runs entirely in the browser (no server required), ensuring fast performance and privacy.
  * **Intuitive UI:** Dynamic matrix creation based on user input (number of variables).

## üíª Tech Stack

The entire application is built using standard web technologies:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | **HTML5** | Web page layout and forms. |
| **Styling** | **CSS3** | Visual design and responsiveness. |
| **Logic** | **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** | Core algorithm, matrix manipulation, and dynamic updates. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup and Installation

You can easily run this project locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites

  * A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahmoudragab24/gaussian-solver.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
